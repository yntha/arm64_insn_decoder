# ARM64 Instruction Decoder
Simple side project I'm working on to decode ARM64 instructions and display all of their encoded fields.

## Usage
Simply change `insn_bytes` at the top of the script with the bytes of the instruction as a hexadecimal number.

## Supported Instructions
**Note: This list will grow over time as I encounter additional instructions I need to work with.**
* LDUR
